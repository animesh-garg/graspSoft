Grasping and manipulation of real world objects has been studied for over 
a century. The problem of fixturing objects, whether by use of mechanical 
jigs and fixtures, or by actuated robots, has garnered research interest across
disciplines.

A review of Grasping and closure for robotics is provided by 
Bicchi and Kumar \cite{bicchi2000robotic}. A detailed explanatory material 
on grasping has been provided in \cite{prattichizzo2008grasping}. 

As covered in both \cite{2000robotic, prattichizzo2008grasping}, a 
fundamental requirement of grasping and manipulation is to constraint an object 
in equilibrium and control position and orientation of the object as needed. 
Grasp closure has been characterized in two useful manners: Form Closure and
Force Closure. 

The joint vector of forces and moments at a contact point in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is 
called as wrench. An rigid object grasped by a set of rigid contact points 
(may be fixed or actuated), is said to be form closed if it is impossible to 
move the object. Similarly, a rigid object is said to be force closed if an 
arbitrary wrench can be counteracted by a change in contact wrench intensity.
Force closure is similar to form closure but relaxed to allow for friction 
forces to balance object wrenches. 

In applications of fixturing and grasping in healthcare, often form closure
is preferred  over force closure due to use of passive positioning systems. 
For instance in SRT, patient's head is immobilized using a passive device
ensuring no disturbance while treatment is being delivered. 

Markenscoff et al \cite{markenscoff1990geometry} showed that 3D objects with 
piece-wise smooth boundary (including polyhedra) can be form closed in atmost
seven frictionless contacts. We note that choosing this minimal 
set of contact points can result in a high normal contact force at a subset of 
contacts. In medical fixturing, such characteristics of a fixture are 
undesirable because they may lead to localized pain, skin rupture 
and even injury. Hence we propose the use of redundant contacts for form closure.

%Related work on grasping with redundant contacts
Modular grasping fixtures have been described by Brost and Goldberg al 
\cite{brost1996complete}. Grasping deformable objects has been a challenge 
in manipulation research. Gopalakrishnan and Goldberg 
\cite{gopalakrishnan2004Dspace} describe new techniques using D-Space for
holding deformable parts. Borst et al \cite{borst1999fast} proposed a 
fast and robust grasp planner. Fast grasp planning and fixturing has since been 
explored by a number of research efforts \todo{find papers}.


Teichmann and Mishra \cite{teichmann2000probabilistic} provided an algorithm for 
grasp quality optimization by a reduction of grasping problem given a set 
of contact points to a convex set cover problem. Ferrari and Canny
\cite{ferrari1992planning} published a seminal work on
geometric grasp quality metrics. They quantified the concepts of total 
force and maximum force as convex hull and minkowsky sum of contact wrenches,
respectively.

Wang \cite{wang2000optimum} proposed an optimal 3D part fixture design 
methodology given a point set of contact points.

%List commeercial stuff from Elekta
There are a number of commercial medical patient positioning systems currently
used in clinic. As shown in figure~\ref{fig:leskellFrame}, the Leskell coordinate frame G four tapping screws
keep the frame attached to the patient's head. This frame requires local 
anesthesia to minimize patient discomfort during the procedure. 



Figure~\ref{fig:HeadStep} shows a Elekta HeadStep which is used for
immobilization in cranial as well as head, neck and shoulder procedures.
It uses an elastic mask to cover the face and the head with incisions for 
breathing.

Figure~\ref{fig:HeadFix} shows a Elekta HeadFix which is used for
head immobilization. It uses a vacuum activated head frame system which uses a 
mouthpiece to clamp down the patients upper jaw. The impression of the upper jaw 
is patient specific.

Our work extends the findings of Schulman et al\cite{schulman2011grasping}
to applications in medical fixturing. Furthermore we also propose a method of 
initial generation of feasible contact points using geometric intuitions from 
local curvature and also no-go zones as specified by a phycisian (viz. mouth, eyes,
ears, nose etc.) Similar methods can also be used for generating form/force
closure grasps for physical objects using multi-fingered hands or multiple hands.
